        "description": "Episode 1 - Look into the future of React Native Testing Library with Michał Pierzchała\n\nIn the first episode of our podcast, Mike \"grabbou\" Grabowski(the host) is talking about React Native Testing Library with his guest - Mike Pierzchała (thymikee) who is the owner of the library.\n\nDuring the conversation, they cover such topics as:\n\n* Introduction to the React Native Testing Library\nhttps://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/\n* What is it? What is the case for it? A bit of history?\n* A quick glimpse at the “Testing Library” concept itself\n* Why it has been created? What is this all about?\n* “React Native Testing Library” is under Callstack and separate from the ecosystem – what is the story behind that?\n* What kind of technical differences is between RNTL and the ecosystem? And why so many?\n* The current state of the library\n* What is the future of the React Native Testing Library?\n\n#reactnative #callstack\n\nLearn more about React Native testing from our blog:\n1. React Native Testing Library 2.0 – What’s New?\nhttps://callstack.com/blog/react-native-testing-library-2-0/\n\n2. Merge of React Native Testing Libraries\nhttps://callstack.com/blog/merge-of-react-native-testing-libraries/\n\n3. React Native Testing Library with Redux\nhttps://callstack.com/blog/react-native-testing-library-with-redux/\n\n4.
